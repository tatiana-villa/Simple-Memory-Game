## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
w3schools, Stack Overflow

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The biggest challenge I encountered while creating this submission was definitely while writing the Javascript portion of the assignment. I had been familiarized with web development prior to this but had only developed non-interactive websites that had little to no Javascript written in the code. My understanding of web development prior to this assignment was mostly limited to HTML and CSS. I had encountered a bug at a certain point while writing this code. It took me a little while to determine it was a Javascript error as I had believed it simply had to do with my CSS file. I overcame it by thinking carefully about how any of these files could have been causing the error. I eliminated that it was a CSS or HTML code error since I knew that HTML and CSS files were merely in charge of dictating the formatting of a webpage. The nature of the bug helped me determine that it was simply a Javascript error since the formatting was just fine. It was definitely a syntax error in my Javascript functions. Understanding the differences between these file types was really helpful in my successful completion of this assignment.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
The questions I have about web development definitely have to do with Javascript. While I do find the functionality of HTML and CSS files interesting I’d definitely like to know what can really be achieved with Javascript on a webpage. I have only come to understand HTML and CSS so far so thinking about what sort of features Javascript can add to a website really intrigues me. Seeing that Javascript could even control sound in this assignment was something that particularly excited me. I didn’t even consider that Javascript could also turn on sounds! I thought the functions used in this assignment were particularly intriguing and it makes me excited to know that there’s a lot of possibilities in web design outside of simply formatting it via HTML and CSS code.


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this assignment I’d definitely make the game a lot more challenging by adding the optional features suggested to the game. I’d add more buttons, speed up the game at each turn, and use a random secret pattern so that the game generates a new pattern each time. On top of this I’d shuffle the colors around the buttons so that the user will be forced to only remember the colors of the buttons pressed.
